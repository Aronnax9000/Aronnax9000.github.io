# Neanderthal Bride

I just received word from the Neanderthal Clone  
Who recently learnt how to use him a phone  
Researchers down there at McMurdo Sound  
Found a froze cavewoman beaneath the ground  

He's got a GoFundMe for a flight to the pole  
to the shacks that they built up near to the ice hole  
His mood is improved, now his heart starts to sing  
too bad that his new bride is really The Thing  

Oh Caveman oh caveman follow your dream  
As Wilford Brimley and Kurt Russell screams  
Your mate's waiting for you the last of her race  
just give her a minute to put on her face  

Norwegians found her during Antartic night
then made an ill-fated whirly bird flight
