# Neanderthal Bride

I just got some word from the Neanderthal Clone
Who recently learnt how to use him a phone
Researchers down to McMurdo Sound
Found a froze cavewoman beaneath the ground

He's got a GoFundMe for a flight to the pole
to the shacks that they built up near to the ice hole
His mood is improved, now his heart starts to sing
too bad that his new bride is really The Thing

Oh Caveman oh caveman follow your dreams
even as Brimley and Kurt Russell screams
