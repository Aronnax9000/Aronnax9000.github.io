# Neanderthal Bride

I just received word from the Neanderthal Clone  
Who recently learnt how to use him a phone  
Researchers down south there near McMurdo Sound  
Found a cavewoman froze under the ground  

He's got a GoFundMe for a flight to the pole  
to the shacks that they built up near to that ice hole  
His mood is improving, his heart starts to sing  
To meet his new bride will be really The Thing  

Oh Caveman oh caveman follow your dream  
As Wilford Brimley and Kurt Russell scream  
Your mate's waiting for you the last of your race  
just give her a minute to put on her face  

Norwegians found her during Antartic night  
Just antecedent to whirly bird flight  
Her voice was so husky as husky could be  
She's looking for something could it be a tree
