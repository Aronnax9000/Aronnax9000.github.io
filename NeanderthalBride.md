# Neanderthal Bride

I just received word from the Neanderthal Clone  
Who recently learnt how to use him a phone  
Researchers way down south at McMurdo Sound  
Found a cavewoman froze under the ground  

He's got a GoFundMe for a flight to the pole  
to the shacks that they built up near to the ice hole  
His mood is improving, his heart starts to sing  
To have a new bride will be really The Thing  

Oh Caveman oh caveman follow your dream  
As Wilford Brimley and Kurt Russell screams  
Your mate's waiting for you the last of her race  
just give her a minute to put on her face  

Norwegians found her during Antartic night  
antecedent to a whirly bird flight  
Her voice was so husky as husky could be
