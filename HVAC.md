# The HVAC Tech of the Trailer Park

I hate to be bearer of bad news  
but your trailer's AC uses R-22  
I got an old bottle worth its weight in gold 
though it'll tear a new one in the ozone hole  

I won't risk fixing it during the day  
cause we might get busted by the EPA  
so I'll come sometime after dark,   
HVAC Tech of the Trailer Park

Your shower drain's clogged and so is the loo  
I ain't seen the like since Twenty-Ought-Two  
My snake took the hair out along with the lime  
I found an old ring that wasn't there last time  

I know hot water isn't just for fun  
it's a high mark for civilization  
gettin' it working ain't just a lark  
for me the plumber of the trailer park  

I'm the locksmith of the trailer park  
I rekeyed your door when he got smart  
I'll care for your goldfish while you're gone  
thouugh most of what he tells me makes me yawn  

I know you Queen you've got your cares  
I'm just glad I'm here to make repairs  
I'll be by on the next apple cart
