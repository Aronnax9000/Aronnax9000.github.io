# Kid's Table

(modal, like Lily May Ledford's Rocking Chair).

My momma bought me a small guitar and said play it all the time
just keep the music quiet while your dad is drinking wine
She handed me that guitar as I lay me down to rest,
and I strummed my childhood chord as it lay acrost my breast.

The major fourth, the major third were given to my brain
and soon the chromatic scale a teacher did arrange
I played Lightly Row and a dozen Mel Bay lines
with their con vibratos and their del capo to al fines.


If you need to find me, you'll find me just right here
at the place where we are set so we won't tip the evening rear
We're happy with baloney, with some bread and mustard fine
the grownups are a playing round us with their wine
