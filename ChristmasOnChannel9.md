# Christmas On Channel 9 

For Mike Bolado  

(Ode to Hans Gruber)  
Tune: Winter Wonderland

Mister cow boy are you listening  
while your undershirt's a glistening  
I'm here to abscond with some bearer bonds  
John McClane you wouldn't understand  

Theo cut all of the phone lines  
Argyles safe though he needs more lines  
He's stuck unaware with a big teddy bear  
John McClane you wouldn't understand  

When you first arrived you made an unforced error  
by taking off both your socks and shoes  
Your wife is nice but you should treat her fairer  
after all they offered you some booze  

I left the rug all kinda soggy  
with what remains of Mister Akagi  
He'll show you no strife for the rest of his life   
(alt: Though that makes me a choad, I'll still get the code)  
John McClane you couldn't understand  

I've just slain your coke head homie  
on the thirtieth floor of Nakatomi  
The roof's wired to blow everyone that you know  
John McClane you couldn't understand  

When the cops get here they'll play at "law man"  
We'll shoot their lights out and their kneecaps too  
They can drive their RV up here -- some plan!  
RPGs will turn them into goo  

At the last, I'll conspire,  
your honey Holly to expire  
your gun's thrown away, it's now Christmas Day  
John McClane you wouldn't understand  

John McClane you wouldn't understand  
John McClane you'll never understand
